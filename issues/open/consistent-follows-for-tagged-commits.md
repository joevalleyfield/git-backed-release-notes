# ðŸ“Ž Feature: Consistent `Follows:` for Tagged Commits

```yaml
tags: [graph-traversal, tag-logic]
status: open
```

## Problem

Tagged commits currently omit `Follows:` entirely. This breaks backward traversal and creates an asymmetry with `Precedes:`.

## Proposed Behavior

A commit's `Follows:` should always point to the **nearest preceding tag**, even if the commit is itself tagged.

### Example

Given:

```text
A --- B --- C --- D --- E
      ^           ^
    rel-1       rel-2
```

Expected:

- **D** (`rel-2`) â†’ `Follows: rel-1`
- **C** â†’ `Follows: rel-1`
- **B** (`rel-1`) â†’ `Follows: (rel-0, if present)`
- **A** â†’ no `Follows:`

## Rationale

- Enables symmetric and intuitive graph traversal.
- Clarifies commit-release lineage regardless of tagging.
- Simplifies test logic and release annotation features.
