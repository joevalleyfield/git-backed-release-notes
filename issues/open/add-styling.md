# Add Styling

Track planned styling improvements across the app, with a focus on clean defaults, semantic HTML, and graceful fallback when JavaScript is disabled.

## Goals

- Introduce a clean, readable layout for all views
- Ensure the site remains fully usable without JavaScript
- Preserve embedding of structured data for progressive enhancement

## Planned Work

- [ ] Add Bootstrap for baseline layout and typography
- [ ] Integrate Diff2Html for improved diff rendering
- [ ] Pre-render HTML diffs for no-JS fallback on commit pages
- [ ] Refine commit detail page layout (spacing, hierarchy, metadata)
- [ ] Improve scan-ability of index/list pages
- [ ] Apply consistent styling to headers, metadata, and diffs
- [ ] Use semantic HTML tags (`<main>`, `<section>`, etc.)
- [ ] Customize Diff2Html theme (optional)

## Notes

This issue will guide initial styling passes. Functional priorities include readable diffs without JS, visually organized metadata, and consistent typography/layout across views.
