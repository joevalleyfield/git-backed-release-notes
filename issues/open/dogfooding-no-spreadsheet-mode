# Dogfooding: No-Spreadsheet Mode

Support using the app without providing a spreadsheet â€” useful for dogfooding against repos like this one that already contain metadata (e.g., `issues/`, `tags`, commit messages).

## Goal

Allow `python app.py` (with no arguments) to run the app using only the Git repo in the current working directory.

## Tasks

* [ ] Draft feature spec for no-spreadsheet mode
* [ ] Implement fallback behavior when no `.xlsx` is provided
* [ ] Traverse the Git repo and synthesize commit metadata in memory
* [ ] Display index and commit detail pages as usual, even without spreadsheet
* [ ] Gracefully skip features like tagging or issue linking that depend on spreadsheet
* [ ] Write end-to-end test(s) for no-spreadsheet mode
* [ ] Validate `python app.py` runs successfully with only a repo

## Notes

This represents a shift from the original MVP flow. Rather than requiring a spreadsheet to be authored first, this enables real-time inspection and progressive enhancement of a real repo, including this one.
